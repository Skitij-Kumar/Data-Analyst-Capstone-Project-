# Data-Analyst-Capstone-Project-

## Introduction
In this project I have assumed that, I have been hired as a Data Analyst by a global IT and business consulting services firm that is known for their expertise in IT solutions and their team of highly experienced IT consultants. In order to keep pace with changing technologies and remain competitive, our organization regularly analyzes data to help identify future skill requirements.

We will perform the below tasks in jupyter notebook.

## Project Tasks
### 1st Task: Collecting Data
Our first task involves collecting the top programming skills that are most in demand from various sources like job postings, training portals, surveys in formats like csv files, excel sheets, and databases:
- Using APIs
- Using Webscraping
- Exploring the collected data
### 2nd Task: Data Wrangling
In second task we will clean up the data set and make it ready for data analysis by:
- Identify duplicate rows in the data frame.
- Remove duplicate rows from the dataframe.
- Find the number of missing values for all columns.
- Find the value counts for the column "Employment".
- Normalize the data using two existing columns.

In third task we will analyze the data and get more familiar with the data set by:
- Plot a distribution curve, and histogram.
- Find the median, and outliers of particular columns.
- Compute the Inter Quartile Range.
- Find out the upper and lower bounds, and find correlations between numerical columns.
- Create a new dataframe.
### 4th Task: Visualizing data
In fourth task we will visualize the Developer Survey data set by:
- Create a histogram to show the distribution of data.
- Create different plots such as a scatter, bubble or boxplot.
- Create a pie chart, bar chart, and stacked chart to show medians and counts.
### 5th Task: Building Dashboards
In fifth task we will create dashboards on Survey Data using IBM Cognos Analytics on:
- Current technology usage
- Future technology trend
- Demographics
### 6th Task: Presenting the findings
Creating a presentation based on the analysis of your data in the previous tasks, by developing a story of your analysis that should be compelling and easy to understand.
